## Slowly Repracticing Newness

So many things have some kind of supposed ideal way of being done, yet life likes to manufacture interruptions into what might be potentially possible. I want to keep learning things about software and systems, but I don't necessarily have a large chunk or consistent chunk of time to devote to experimenting with something. I need to be able to fit this practice of trying new things, and building on my own understanding to fit into whatever moment or space that presents an oportunity for me. My time is fractured enough as it is between family, spouse, kids, work, friends, etc... that trying to fit one more things means working around all the existing ones.

I want to keep learning, but it's not just about me, there are a lot of other people in my life and everything I do affects them. Rather than sacrificing people around me (because that metaphor is gruesome) for my own enjoyment or benefit, it is important that learning and growing skills is done in a way that works with and around all the other responsibilities and commitments I already have.



...it may take some time to hammer out the snapsis trapped in my head and form them into actual comprehensible words, please be patient with life...

## In progress part...

It feels like when I go searching for things there are a lot of quick starts and how to get up and running fast… and that’s nice in some respects to get something in place that you can see how it works and start adjusting things to see how you might be able to change it into what you want or see what it can do. The kind of things I really enjoy are the in depth things that go on a really deep dive into something where you get to learn about all kinds of obscure things that most people don’t see or ever noticed were there. I like the slow approach to things because I feel like it gives me an opportunity to absorb and digest things and see how the how works together as the sum of its pieces. I don’t want to just know things in the surface, I want to dive into the depths and understand the intricate details, and uncover the why that surrounds parts of what it does. The problem is that the slow approach takes time, a lot of time, so I need a way to break it up. I need to be able to start quickly, experiment with things, pause it all, and bit just pause when it’s convenient, then be able to identify all the pieces that everything was in at a later date so that I can resume whatever experiment was going on, and continue where I left off. 

This whole desire to be able to start, stop, start, stop whenever, has lead me to taking better notes, and putting effort into structuring and organizing things so that future me can remember what was going on when the experiment monster was alive last.  I am now always operating with a text file open where I hit stuff down as I go, and keep notes of commands executed, and try to map out steps just before I execute a series of actions. This part is a behavior change that takes a lot of practice to get good at, but the benefits can be pretty vast.

I started messing with Terraform back in 2017 to be able to create cloud resources and was able to leverage some growing experience with Ansible to then configure those resources (virtual machines). This led me to wanting the ability to try things out in the cloud where I could just build something play with it then destroy it all and put all my toys away. I worked hard to combine the pieces where I could stand up and tear down systems for various experiments, but it still takes time to stand things up and tear them down. I started this idea of wanting a virtual lab where I could spin up and tear down experiments and be able to just try something in different pieces and stages and build out a way to organize the various pieces. It helped to keep things manageable, but I keep looking for ways to make things quicker and more iterative. 

I am very cautious by nature so I have to push myself to go faster and be willing to run into some broken things, especially when I’m just experimenting with things. While I recognize the importance of getting things done, I don’t want to have to do something over and over again because I keep getting it wrong, so a lot of my go fast activity I try and organize around safety. If something breaks, I want it to break in a safe way, and be able to resume from a failure and keep going. I have also worked with other engineers with some of the same structures I’ve built and tried to impart some concepts of where the structures provide safety and areas where I have found dragons to avoid. It’s important to be able to try something and not worry about if it breaks, but it’s also important to know what the safety measures are for those areas you want to move fast in so you know it’s safe to be a bit reckless and just plow through things to get to the other side.

I recognize the fact that I have a lot of privilege within the struggle that I find it difficult to locate time to keep on building. For me it’s a matter of trying to fit the ever changing industry into my own schedule to keep up with and do better. Other people have other limitations, or a whole bunch of them all piled on suffocating and creating barriers restricting people from accessing the very thing that could help them, the ability to slowly and iteratively learn the ever growing pile of new things.
