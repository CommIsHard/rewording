## Slowly Repracticing Newness

So many things have some kind of supposed ideal way of being done, yet life likes to manufacture interruptions into what might be potentially possible. I want to keep learning things about software and systems, but I don't necessarily have a large chunk or consistent chunk of time to devote to experimenting with something. I need to be able to fit this practice of trying new things, and building on my own understanding to fit into whatever moment or space that presents an oportunity for me. My time is fractured enough as it is between family, spouse, kids, work, friends, etc... that trying to fit one more things means working around all the existing ones.

I want to keep learning, but it's not just about me, there are a lot of other people in my life and everything I do affects them. Rather than sacrificing people around me (because that metaphor is gruesome) for my own enjoyment or benefit, it is important that learning and growing skills is done in a way that works with and around all the other responsibilities and commitments I already have.



...it may take some time to hammer out the snapsis trapped in my head and form them into actual comprehensible words, please be patient with life...
